# Creatina

**Mental training through interactive narrative dilemmas.**

Creatina is a contemplative application that guides you through realistic, morally complex scenarios. Each dilemma presents a series of seven decision points. Your choices don't lead to "correct" outcomes—instead, they reveal how you deliberate when something genuinely matters.

## The Experience

### 1. Homepage
Browse available dilemmas and learn about the experience. Each dilemma explores a different dimension of human decision-making.

### 2. Dilemma Entry
Read the context and premise of the dilemma. Understand what's at stake before you begin.

### 3. Seven Episodes
Each episode presents a moment of decision with five choices (A–E). The narrative evolves based on the passages, but your choices don't affect which episodes appear—they affect how you understand yourself.

### 4. Transition
A brief pause between the narrative and reflection.

### 5. Report
Six analytical sections examine your deliberation pattern, the tensions you navigate, the values you reveal, and how you relate to uncertainty. This is not a judgment—it's an observation.

### 6. Post-Report Options
Choose to explore another dilemma, review your report, or return home.

## Available Dilemmas

### The Promotion Dilemma
**Ambition and Belonging**

A significant career opportunity requires leaving your community. How do you weigh professional growth against personal relationships?

### The Compromise Dilemma
**Integrity and Pragmatism**

A business opportunity requires adjusting a personal principle. Where is the line between integrity and pragmatism?

### The Commitment Dilemma
**Freedom and Obligation**

A deepening relationship asks for commitment. Can you commit without losing your independence?

## Design Philosophy

- **No Gamification**: No scoring, no achievements, no rewards. Just choices and their implications.
- **No "Right Answers"**: Every option carries weight. Multiple perspectives are equally valid.
- **Text First**: The narrative is the experience. The UI disappears behind the words.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: High contrast, ample whitespace, restrained color. A calm environment for deep thinking.
- **Serious Tone**: No manipulation, emotional manipulation, or artificial urgency. Observant. Adult.

## Technology

Built with Next.js 16 and React 19, using:
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for responsive design
- **EB Garamond** for serif typography (editorial, serious)
- **Source Sans 3** for body text (clean, readable)
- Minimalist OKLCh color system for accessibility and restraint

## Privacy

Your choices and reports remain private. No data is collected or stored. This experience is for you alone.

## Duration

Each dilemma takes approximately 15–20 minutes. The experience is fully self-paced. You may pause and return later.
